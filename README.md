# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage about UFO sightings with a dynamic table that responds to multiple filters. The webpage was built using JavaScript & HTML along with CSS styling. The table, filled with UFO sighting data, is able to be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

1. Clear Filters button
2. Date Range Filter rather than one date
