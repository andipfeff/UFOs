# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage about UFO sightings with a dynamic table that responds to multiple filters. The webpage was built using JavaScript & HTML along with CSS styling. The table, filled with UFO sighting data, is able to be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The following steps walk through using the webpage filters:

- The filter pane is located about halfway down the page on the left hand side

- Input desired search criteria in one or more of the filters

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Filtering using **ONE** filter:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Filtering using **MULTIPLE** filters:

- Clear the filter inputs to reset the table to include all UFO sightings


## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

1. Clear Filters button
2. Date Range Filter rather than one date
3. Multiple Filter Criteria
